Resilience Development for Electric Energy Delivery Systems

## üß† Overview

Resilience Development for Electric Energy Delivery Systems (ResDEEDS) is a decision-support tool designed to guide users through the assessment of electric energy delivery systems (EEDS) resilience. Built on top of the PyPSA (Python for Power System Analysis) framework, ResDEEDS automates the core steps of the INL Resilience Framework for EEDS. It enables systematic evaluation, tracks resilience planning activities, and offers data-driven recommendations for mitigating potential hazards.
